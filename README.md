# CSI-DevHacks Task 1

## Introduction
In this task, we'll focus on the fundamentals of web development. Web development is a basic skill which is often said as a good start to the development field. We'll help you focus on the web development basics using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Assignment

This week tasks will be on the basic of UI and UX development. It will comprise of making simple games like TIC-TAC-TOE and SUDOKU .

**Note** : You have to choose one of them.

### [TIC-TAC-TOE](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)

The task that we'll be working over is to build a TIC-TAC-TOE game , a multi-player classic game where both players will have to choose between X or O .The first player to complete a diagonal, vertical or a horizontal blocks wins the game.

### Tasks

- **Task 1**: Implement a two-player mode that allows two people to compete against each other.
- **Task 2**: Add a single-player mode that allows users to play with an intelligent bot that never loses.
- **Task 3**: Add an option to select which shape to begin with (X/O).
- **Task 4:** In single-player mode, add an option to choose who will start first - computer or player.
- **Extras:** You may keep a record of scores and use player names for interactivity.


### [SUDOKU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku)

Sudoku is a logic-based puzzle game .The aim of the Sudoku puzzle is to put in a numerical digit from 1 through 9 in each
cell of a 9√ó9 grid made up of 3√ó3 sub-grids (called "block‚Äù), starting with various digits
given in some cells (the "givens") with the others empty; each row, column, and block
must contain only one instance of each numeral.

Complexity of the algorithm that are used in building are divided into two parts.
- One is the complexity of the algorithm to generate the complete grid. We discover the randomness of generating complete grid increases when the complexity increases, that is, the randomness higher and the complexity greater.

- Second, is the algorithm to assign numbers in grid and check for each row , column and block and declare the final result .

### Tasks

- **Task 1**: Implement a Sudoku game. (The board may remain the same every time).
- **Task 2**: Implement a board generator and generate a random board in every game. You may use backtracking or naive approaches to generate the board.
- **Task 3:** Add a timer to the game, where the user may select a particular time to complete the game within it. **Bonus**: As the time reaches 0, the user can be warned about the time running out.
- **Task 4:** Warning the user about incorrect inputs and user engagement.
- **Extras:** To make the game more engaging, you may provide hints if the user is stuck for like 10-20 seconds.

## Judging

The evaluation would be done mainly on the following basis:

1. User Interface and User Experience
2. Authenticity and readability of the code
3. Completion of mentioned tasks
4. Bonus Points for implementing extra features depending on your creativityüòâ


## Instructions to Submit
-   Fork the project to your GitHub account.
-   Clone it in your system.
-   Create a folder with your github username in your cloned local repository.
-   Complete the task by adding all the required files in your project.
-   Make sure that you add the files in the separate folder created and not put the files directly in the home folder.
-   When done, commit your work locally and push it to origin.
-   Deploy your game online.
-   Make a pull request to our repository with proper description and url where you have deployed your game.
-   Let us review your pull request.
